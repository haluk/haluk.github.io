I'm a PhD candidate in the [Computer Science Department](https://cse.unl.edu/) at [University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL)](https://www.unl.edu/). I am co-advised by [Stephen Scott](https://cse.unl.edu/~sscott/) and [Juan Cui](https://cse.unl.edu/~jcui/). I work on machine learning with focus on graphical models and Bayesian statistics. Before joining UNL, I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Engineering from [Bogazici University](http://boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index) under the supervision of [Arzucan Ozgur](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~ozgur/). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Istanbul Bilgi University](https://www.bilgi.edu.tr/en/). I also worked in industry as a Java backend developer.
